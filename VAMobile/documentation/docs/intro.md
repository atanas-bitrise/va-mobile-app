# Intro to the VA Mobile App?

## Background

Nearly 40% of all traffic to VA.gov comes from users on their mobile devices. This traffic is typically driven by users that want to complete quick transactions, such as viewing Claims Status or Facility Locator.

The VA: Health and Benefits App team has a hypothesis, validated by user research, that native functionality in a mobile app will allow Veterans to more easily complete key transactions across VA Health and Benefits services.

## Getting Started as an Experience Team

Below, you'll find some high level steps you need to get started with the app as an experience team.

1. Fill out a [change request form](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/new?template=feature-request.yml) for your feature
2. Start the design process
3. Get designs approved by VA Mobile product owners
4. Request a [test plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/new?template=QA_Test_Plan.md) from Mobile QA
5. Start feature implementation

If you have an engineer who needs to build in the VA Health and Benefits mobile app (and they are already onboarded into the VA organization), you can fill out a [mobile engineering onboarding request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/new?template=onboarding-request-engineering.yml).
